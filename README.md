# CampaignEQ's Responsive Data Frontend

Our responsive data frontend is based on Bootstrap 3. We layer on our own lightweight javascript using the jquery library. Also we use Retina.js for retina 2x images.

## About CampaignEQ
CampaignEQ is a SaaS marketing attribution platform for sophisticated marketers. Our platform combines all the essential pieces of a robust marketing program:
- Affiliate Network Management
- Data Cohort Analysis
- A/B Opimization & Device Routing
- Customer Referral Tracking

## We have a LOT of data in our system
Consuming all of our data is a pretty tough job. We wanted to share our idea of a data-heavy responsive frontend. It won't work for everyone, but hopefully it will help some folks out there think about their application.

Some of the things that are unique about our frontend:
- Responsive multi-level navigation
- Responsive table columns
- Single responsive break-point (this makes things so much more simple, and avoids a 'jumpy' interface)
